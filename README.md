# 🪙 Crypto Volatility Prediction Project

## 📊 Overview
This project predicts short-term cryptocurrency volatility using historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data.  
It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning model training, and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze and clean crypto price data
- Create features like returns, rolling volatility, and volume ratios
- Train a model (Random Forest / XGBoost) to predict next 7-day volatility
- Visualize insights and deploy via Streamlit app

---

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.9+
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Streamlit (for web app)
- GitHub (for version control)
